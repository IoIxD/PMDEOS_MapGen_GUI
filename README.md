 This is a GUI for a [Python library based on ](https://github.com/SkyTemple/dungeon-eos/) [Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky's](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon:_Explorers_of_Sky) [map generation system.](https://github.com/SkyTemple/dungeon-eos/)

 *Employers looking at my Github profile, for any reason, should not take this as an example of my programming skills. I am much better with Golang and Javascript then I am Python. I also tried for four days to rewrite the original library in Golang and gave up. I honestly wouldn't open source this if it weren't for the license.* **On that note, pull requests aren't accepted because I don't want this to show up anywhere near the top of my "repositories" list, but if you feel that there are major improvements to be made you can feel free to fork it.**
