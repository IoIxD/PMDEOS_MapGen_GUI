This is a GUI for a [Python library based on ](https://github.com/SkyTemple/dungeon-eos/) [Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky's](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon:_Explorers_of_Sky) [map generation system.](https://github.com/SkyTemple/dungeon-eos/)

*Employers looking at my Github profile, for any reason, should not take this as an example of my programming skills. I am much better with Golang and Javascript then I am Python. I also tried for four days to rewrite the original library in Golang and gave up. I honestly wouldn't open source this if it weren't for the license.* ***On that note, pull requests aren't accepted because I don't want this to show up anywhere near the top of my "repositories" list, but if you feel that there are major improvements to be made you can feel free to fork it.***

## Running

- [Download Python for your operating system](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - If you are on Linux you should use your distro's package manager instead, [the command you need to enter into the terminal is probably listed here](https://command-not-found.com/python)
- On Windows, make sure "add Python to my PATH" is selected.
- Download GTK. This is bundled with most Linux distros (thought PyGTK might not be), on Windows you should grab the [PyGTK installer](https://download.gnome.org/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.22/) to get it.
- Open `cmd.exe` on Windows or the Terminal on MacOS/Linux, and type `cd <whatever folder you extract these files to>`
- Do `python main.py`
- You should see a GUI for generating your dungeon, but if you don't you can feel free to DM me on Discord or open an issue on the issues page.
